Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its the systematic application of engineering principlaes, methods and tools to the development and maintennace of high qualiaty software systems
Importance: Enabling creation of sofware applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life eg communication, commerce, entertainments and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
Development of programming languages 
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline. 
The advent of structured  programming 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- collecting and understanding user requirements 
Design- Create detailed design of software and user interface.
Implementation- writing code and building sofware according to design specification  
Testing- Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functionality
Deployment- Releasing the sofware to users
Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancemnets to sofware after delopyment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves sequential approach, the steps following each other while Agile involves repetitive incremental approach focussed on flexibility and collaboration. 
Waterfall is best appropriate in scenarios where the project requirements are unlikely to change, has clear deliverables and has strict regulatory requirements that demand documentation.
Agile is best suited in projects that the scope is uncertain and customer feedback is crucial throughout the process

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Sofware developer- writes code and implements software solutions 
Quality Assurance engineer- ensures quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager- oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software systems. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging, and testing, allowing developers to work more efficiently. Example: Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A lightweight but powerful IDE from Microsoft, known for its flexibility and extensive library of extensions. It supports multiple programming languages and is widely used for web development, Python, and more.
VCSs allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. They manage contributions from different team members, making it easier to collaborate on complex projects.
eg A web-based platform built on top of Git that provides additional collaboration tools, including pull requests, issue tracking, and continuous integration
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Tight deadlines- pressure to deliver products on schedule can rsult to rushed developemnt and compromised quality. 
Strategy: Prioritization of the most critical tasks first and communication to stakeholders to set realistic expectations. 
Automation of repetitive tasks like testing and deployment. 
2.Changing requirements- leading to scope creep and project delays. 
Strategy;Use VCS to effectively to manae changes and ensure the team can roll bcak to previous versions if needed and frequesnt communication with stakeholdes to clarify requiremnets and manage expectations. 
3.Technical debt- accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions. 
Strategy: regulalrly asses and prioritize debt to address most critical issues, allocate time in each sprint to adress the debt and automation of testing to detect and prevent reintroduction of issues when updating code. 
4. Keeping up with rapidly changing technology. This can be curbed by continous learning and networkin to stay infromed about industry trends. 
5. Communicating technical conceppts to non technical stakeholders leading to misunderstanding and misaligned expectations. 
Stragtegy: using simple language to explain complex concepts and using visuals to convey ideas more clearly. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individial components or modules of sofware. This ensures that each component meetscertain standards and any faults are quickly identified and fixed. 
Integration testing- testing between diffrent components. This helps to understand if diffrent components work well together. 
System testing- testing the entire software system as a whole. This focuses on evaluating how differen components of an application interact together in full and testing the overall functionality of the application. 
Acceptance testing- testing the software aganist user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It assesses if the product can handle real world scenarios. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statemnts to get the best possible responses from AI. This helps in making your prompst clear, consice and specific so the Ai understands excatly what you need. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Discuss Covid 19 
Improved Propmt: In an essay, discuss the emergence of covid 19 and its effects in the economy of Kenya. Have on opening and closing. Write is an engaging tone. 
My propmt is more effective because it gives what excatly I want discussed, the format and the tone to be used.
